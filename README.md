# 🚀 API Handling App

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a demonstration of my expertise in building **full-stack applications** using modern technologies. The app consists of a **separate frontend (React)** and **backend (Node.js with Express.js)** to showcase API handling, data fetching, and efficient state management. 

## ✨ Features
- 🛠️ **Backend API with Express.js**: Provides product data with search functionality.
- 🎨 **Frontend with React**: Fetches data from the backend and implements a search feature.
- 🔗 **Axios for API Calls**: Ensures efficient communication between frontend and backend.
- ⏳ **Loading and Error Handling**: Implements loading states and error messages for a better user experience.
- 🚦 **AbortController for Request Cancellation**: Prevents unnecessary API calls and handles request race conditions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ⚡ **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- 🎭 **Frontend**: React, Axios
- 🔄 **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
